Notes: 
 1. The following variablea are averages for the specified subject-activity observations
 2. Variables that begin with 't' are time domain signals that were captured at
    a constant rate of 50 Hz, then filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order
	low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
 3. Variables that contain 'Acc' come from the phone's accelerometer. These 
    signals were then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
    (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter 
    with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
  4. Variables that contain 'Gyro' come from the phone's gyroscope  
  5. X,Y,Z are axis/direction labels 
  6. Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were differentiated in time to
     obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the 
     magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean 
     norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
  7. Variables that begin with 'f' come from a frequency domain Fast Fourier 
     Transform (FFT) that was applied to some of these signals producing;
 	 fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag,
	 fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.  
  8. The experiments/observations have been carried out with a group of 30
     volunteers between [19-48] years of age. Each person performed six activities 
     (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
     wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded 
     accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial 
     angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.   
  9. The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard
     gravity units 'g', and have been normalized and bounded within [-1,1]  
 10. The angular velocity measurement units are radians/second, and have been
     normalized and bounded within [-1,1]
